### üï∞ Daily Almanax Notification

At 00:01 Europe/France Timezone (GMT+2) (server time), the bot will send the `/alma` command to a channel named `almanax` or any other named defined by the `/config` command.  
If you wish to disable this behavior, simply deny permission to this bot on that channel.

### üë• Party Listing

When using `/party-create` command, the bot will create a new party list and it'll post it on the channel defined by the `/config` command (`listagem-de-grupos` by default).  
It'll also listen to reactions so members can join or leave groups.  
To make use of this feature, make sure that the bot has enough permissions to the configured channel.  

**Examples**:
```bash
/party-create name: Boss Smasher
/party-create name: Ogrest description: If it's your first time, it's okay date: Tomorrow 8PM level: 200 slots: 3
```

### üåé Internationalization

Most commands accept `lang: <lang>` and `translate: <lang>` options.  
A server administrator can also set the default language with `/config` command.  
Available languages are `en`, `es`, `pt` and `fr`.

### üõ° Equipment search

An equipment search is available with `/equip name: <name>` command.  
It's also possible to filter them by a rarity option.
If a recipe is associated, it can be displayed by reacting with üõ†Ô∏è  

**Examples**:
```bash
/equip name: martelo de osamodas lang: pt
/equip name: the eternal rarity: mythical
```

### üíé Sublimation search

The command `/subli` can search by sublimation name, type, rarity and slots combination.  
When searching by slots combination, it's possible to match with white slots and/or by random ordering.  

**Examples**:
```bash
/subli by-name name: bruta
/subli by-name name: bruta translate: fr
/subli by-name name: talho lang: pt
/subli by-slots slots: rwb
/subli by-slots slots: rgbg random: true
/subli by-slots slots: epic
```

### üìú Recipe search

Similar to the commands above, you can search for recipes by name and rarity.  
Recipes with same results are shown together.  

**Examples**:
```bash
/recipe name: brakmar sword
/recipe name: espada de brakmar lang: pt
/recipe name: peace pipe rarity: mythical
/recipe name: o eterno rarity: m√≠tico lang: pt
```

### ü•ä Damage Calculator

It's possible to simulate an attack by providing some numbers to the `.calc` commands.  
Maybe in the future we can add new options to it.  

Examples:
```bash
/calc dmg:3000 base:55 res:60%
/calc dmg:5000 base:40 res:420 crit:30%
```

### üë∑ Builder Integration

By sending a Zenith's build link, the bot will access the link, take a printscreen and send it as a preview to the chat.  
It'll also sum the highest elemental damage with all other non-negative secundary masteries and display it on the message.  
You can disable this behavior by using `.config set buildPreview=disabled`  
**Note: this feature is currently disabled since Zenith has changed their interface. If you wish it back, please consider [supporting](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/markkop).**

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable options

Some bot options can be configurable according to each server using `.config`.  
**Options**:
* lang: default bot language between fr, en, es and pt (default: en)
* almanaxChannel: channel to receive the `.alma` command daily (default: almanax)
* partyChannel: channel to receive the `.party` command (default: listagem-de-grupos)
* buildPreview: `enabled` (default) or `disabled` to show a build printscreen and other info

**Examples**:
```bash
/config get
/config set lang: en
/config set almanax-channel: #temple-bonus
/config set party-channel: #party-listing
```

## Disabled Features

The following features are currently disabled due to external limitations, such as scrapping protection in Ankama's websites.

### üåå Krosmoz Almanax

Inspired by [wakmanax](https://github.com/elio-centrique/wakmanax), the `/alma` command used to scrap [Krosmoz Almanax](http://www.krosmoz.com/en/almanax) page and returned tons of cool stuff such as Protector of the Day, Zodiac, Trivia, Event and Forecast.

### üê≤ Monster search

When Wakfu's web scrapping was working, we could search for monsters by typing `/mob name: ogrest`, for example  
It would show their characteristics, damage, resistances, drops and spells.
